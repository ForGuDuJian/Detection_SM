# Detection_SM
This repository includes the source code for YOLOv5.<br>
It is recommanded to use the ananconda and create the virtual environment for the model to detect spinal metastasis. The yolov5 folder can be refered for the environment configuration.<br>
## Installation
Trained and validated with Python3.8.<br>
PyTorch should be installed with the appropriate CUDA version for your hardware before installing requirements.txt.<br>

	$ conda create --name Detection_SM python=3.8
	$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
	$ conda install --file requirements.txt -c pytorch
 ## Data preparation
The labels were generated by imaging annotation tools:[LabelImg](https://pypi.org/project/labelImg/)<br>
Label format:

	Class-number X-Center Y-Center X-Length Y-Length
Image and label files should have the same filename except for their extension (e.g. `img-00001.jpg` corresponds to label `img-00001.txt`).

Data yaml files can be modeled after `/data/xxx.yaml` and should be saved in the `/data/` folder. The images and text labels should be organized into folders as follows:

>|---datasets<br>

>>|---subdirectory<br>

>>>|---images<br>

>>>>|---train<br>

>>>>>|---img-xxx.jpg<br>

>>>>>|---...<br>

>>>>|---val<br>

>>>>>|---img-xxx.jpg<br>

>>>>>|---...<br>

>>>|---labels<br>

>>>>|---train<br>

>>>>>|---img-xxx.txt<br>

>>>>>|---...<br>

>>>>|---val<br>

>>>>>|---img-xxx.txt<br>
